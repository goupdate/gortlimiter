# Project: Go Concurrency Runtime Limiter (gortlimiter)

## Overview

The Go Concurrency Runtime Limiter (gortlimiter) is a highly efficient and robust solution designed to manage concurrent operations in Go applications. It's an indispensable tool *for controlling the number of goroutines executing simultaneously*, thus preventing overloading of system resources. Ideal for applications dealing with high throughput or handling multiple IO-bound tasks, this package ensures optimal resource utilization and improves overall application performance.

## Features

- **Efficient Concurrency Management**: Limits the number of goroutines running in parallel, effectively managing system resources.
- **Easy Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with existing Go applications.
- **Scalability**: Designed to scale effortlessly with your application's needs.
- **Thread-Safety**: Ensures safe concurrent access, eliminating race conditions.
- **Customizable Concurrency Limit**: Allows you to set a specific concurrency limit according to your application's requirements.

## Usage

Here's a simple example to demonstrate how to use the Go Concurrency Limiter in your project:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
    "github.com/goupdate/gortlimiter"
)

func main() {
    // Create a new limiter with a concurrency limit of 5
    l := limiter.New(5)

    for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
        go func(i int) {
            child := l.Get() // Acquire a slot
            defer child.End() // Release the slot once done

            // Your concurrent task here
            fmt.Printf("Running task %d\n", i)
            time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
        }(i)
    }

    // Wait to prevent the main goroutine from exiting
    time.Sleep(20 * time.Second)
}
```

This example creates a limiter with a concurrency limit of 5, ensuring that only 5 goroutines run simultaneously.
